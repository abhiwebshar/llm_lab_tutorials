1.  Antral gastritis.2.  Duodenal polyp. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photos and antral biopsy. 

ANESTHESIA: 
Demerol and Versed. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
Consent was obtained after all risks and benefits were described.  The patient was brought back into the Endoscopy Suite.  The aforementioned anesthesia was given.  Once the patient was properly anesthetized, bite block was placed in the patient's mouth.  Then, the patient was given the aforementioned anesthesia.  Once he was properly anesthetized, the endoscope was placed in the patient's mouth that was brought down to the cricopharyngeus muscle into the esophagus and from the esophagus to his stomach.  The air was insufflated down.  The scope was passed down to the level of the antrum where there was some evidence of gastritis seen.  The scope was passed into the duodenum and then duodenal sweep where there was a polyp seen.  The scope was pulled back into the stomach in order to flex upon itself and straightened out.  Biopsies were taken for CLO and histology of the antrum.  The scope was pulled back.  The junction was visualized.  No other masses or lesions were seen.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will recommend the patient be on some type of a H2 blocker.  Further recommendations to follow.

Sample Name: 
Cataract Extraction - 1. 

Description: 
Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens placement by phacoemulsification.  A peribulbar block was given to the eye using 8 cc of a mixture of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine mixed with Wydase plus one-half of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens placement by phacoemulsification. 

ANESTHESIA: 
Peribulbar. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient was brought to the operating room after the eye was dilated with topical Mydriacyl and Neo-Synephrine drops.  A Honan balloon was placed over the eye for a period of 20 minutes at 10 mmHg.  A peribulbar block was given to the eye using 8 cc of a mixture of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine mixed with Wydase plus one-half of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The Honan balloon was then re-placed over the eye for an additional 10 minutes at 20 mmHg.  The eye was prepped with a Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A wire speculum was placed in the eye and then a clear corneal paracentesis site was made inferiorly with a 15-degree blade, followed by instillation of 0.1 cc of preservative-free lidocaine 1% into the anterior chamber, followed by viscoelastic.  A 2.8-mm keratome was used to create a self-sealing temporal corneal incision and then a bent capsulotomy needle was used to create an anterior capsular flap.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous tear capsulorrhexis, and hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus was performed with BSS on a cannula.  Phacoemulsification in a quartering-and-cracking technique was used to remove the nucleus and then the residual cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  Gentle vacuuming of the central posterior capsule was performed.  The capsular bag was re-expanded with viscoelastic, and then the wound was opened to a 3.4-mm size with an additional keratome to allow insertion of the intraocular lens.The intraocular lens was folded, inserted into the capsular bag and then un-folded.  The trailing haptic was tucked underneath the anterior capsular rim.  The lens was shown to center very well.  Therefore, the viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit and one 10-0 nylon suture was placed across the incision after Miochol was injected into the anterior chamber to cause pupillary constriction.  The wound was shown to be watertight.  Therefore, TobraDex ointment was applied to the eye, an eye pad loosely applied and a Fox shield taped firmly in place.The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.

Surgery. 

Sample Name: 
Nephrectomy. 

Description: 
Left laparoscopic hand-assisted nephrectomy. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left renal mass, left renal bleed. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left renal mass, left renal bleed. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Left laparoscopic hand-assisted nephrectomy. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General endotracheal. 

EBL: 
100 mL.The patient had a triple-lumen catheter A-line placed. 

BRIEF HISTORY: 
The patient is a 54-year-old female with history of diabetic nephropathy, diabetes, hypertension, left BKA, who presented with abdominal pain with left renal bleed.  The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery. 

DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: 
The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.

Sample Name: 
Multiple Neurological Symptoms. 

Description: 
The patient is with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and &quot;walks like a duck.&quot;  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
He has had diabetes for five years.  He also has had hypercholesterolemia.  He has had Crohn's disease for 25 or 30 years.  He has had a colostomy for four years.  He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn's disease.  He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  He has depression.  He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago. 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia. 

ALLERGIES: 
He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: 
He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife.  He does not really have any hobbies. 

FAMILY HISTORY: 
His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  He has another sister with diabetes.  He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
He has dyspnea on exertion.  He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  He has occasional night sweats.  His hearing is poor.  He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn's disease.  He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis.  He has a history of anemia.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.

RADIOLOGIC DATA: 
MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08  Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.  Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression.Thoracic MRI spine without contrast  Minor degenerative changes without stenosis.I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review. 

LABORATORY DATA: 
10/07/08  Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0. 

ASSESSMENT: 
The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.6.  I also am checking another CPK to see if there is any elevation.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - 10. 

Description: 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsies for H. pylori x2 with biopsy forceps.  Nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain. 

POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 
Normal upper endoscopy. 

OPERATION: 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsies for H. pylori x2 with biopsy forceps. 

ANESTHESIA: 
IV sedation 50 mg Demerol, 8 mg of Versed. 

PROCEDURE: 
The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite.  After adequate IV sedation with the above medications, hurricane was sprayed in the mouth as well as in the esophagus.  A bite block was placed and the gastroscope placed into the mouth and was passed into the esophagus and negotiated through the esophagus, stomach, and pylorus.  The first, second, and third portions of the duodenum were normal.  The scope was withdrawn into the antrum which was normal and two bites with the biopsy forceps were taken in separate spots for H. pylori.  The scope was retroflexed which showed a normal GE junction from the inside of the stomach and no evidence of pathology or paraesophageal hernia.  The scope was withdrawn at the GE junction which was in a normal position with a normal transition zone.  The scope was then removed throughout the esophagus which was normal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.The plan is to obtain a HIDA scan as the right upper quadrant ultrasound appeared to be normal, although previous ultrasounds several years ago showed a gallstone.

Physical Therapy - Ankle Sprain. 

Description: 
Ankle sprain, left ankle.  The patient tripped over her dog toy and fell with her left foot inverted.  The patient states that she received a series of x-rays and MRIs that were unremarkable.  After approximately 1 month, the patient continued to have significant debilitating pain in her left ankle.  She then received a walking boot and has been in the boot for the past month. 

DIAGNOSIS: 
Ankle sprain, left ankle. 

HISTORY: 
The patient is a 31-year-old female who was referred to Physical Therapy secondary to a fall on 10/03/08.  The patient states that she tripped over her dog toy and fell with her left foot inverted.  The patient states that she received a series of x-rays and MRIs that were unremarkable.  After approximately 1 month, the patient continued to have significant debilitating pain in her left ankle.  She then received a walking boot and has been in the boot for the past month. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Significant for hypertension, asthma, and cervical cancer.  The cervical cancer was diagnosed as 15 years old.  The patient states that her cancer is &quot;dormant.&quot;. 

MEDICATIONS: 
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide.2.  Lisinopril.3.  Percocet.The patient states that the Percocet helps to take the edge of her pain, but does not completely eliminate it. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
The patient rates the pain at 2/10 on the pain analog scale.  The patient states that with elevation and rest, her pain subsides. 

FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES/HOBBIES: 
Currently limited including basic household chores and activities, this does increases her pain.  The patient states she also recently joined Weight Watchers and was involved in a walking routine and is currently unable to participate in this activity. 

WORK STATUS: 
The patient is currently on medical leave as a paraprofessional.  The patient states that she works as a teacher's aide in the school system and is required to complete extensive walking and standing activities.  The patient states that she is primarily on her feet while at work and rarely has a sitting break for extensive period of time.  The patient's goal is to be able to stand and walk without pain. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: 
The patient lives in a private home with children and her father.  The patient states that she does have stairs to negotiate without the use of a railing.  She states that she is able to manage the stairs, however, is very slow with her movement.  The patient smokes 1-1/2 packs of cigarettes a day and does not have a history of regular exercise routine. 

OBJECTIVE: 
Upon observation, the patient is a very obese female who is ambulating with significant antalgic gait pattern and altered normal gait due to the pain as well as the walking boot.  Upon inspection of the left ankle, it appears to have swelling, unsure if this swelling is secondary to injury or water retention as the patient states she has significant water retention.  When compared to right ankle edema, it is approximately equal.  There is no evidence of discoloration or temperature.  The patient states that she had no bruising at the time of injury.Active range of motion of left ankle is as follows  Dorsiflexion is 6 degrees past neutral and plantar flexion is 54 degrees, eversion 20 degrees, and inversion is 30 degrees.  Left ankle dorsiflexion lacks 10 degrees from neutral and plantar flexion is 36 degrees, this motion is very painful.  The patient was tearful during this activity.  Eversion is 3 degrees and inversion is 25 degrees.  The patient states this movement was difficult, but not painful.  Strength testing of the right lower extremity is grossly 4+-5/5 and left ankle is 2/5 as the patient is unable to obtain full range of motion. 

PALPATION: 
The patient is very tender to palpation primarily along the lateral malleolus of the left ankle. 

JOINT PLAY: 
Unable to be assessed secondary to the patient's extreme tenderness and guarding of the ankle joint. 

SPECIAL TESTS: 
A 6-minute walk test.  The patient was able to ambulate approximately 600 feet while wearing her walking boot prior to her pain significantly increasing in the ankle and requiring the test to be stopped. 

ASSESSMENT: 
The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention as a trial of treatment in order to address the following problem list1.  Increased pain.2.  Decreased range of motion.3.  Decreased strength.4.  Decreased ability to complete work task and functional activities in the home.5.  Decreased gait pattern. 

SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 3 WEEKS: 
1.  The patient will demonstrate independence with home exercise program.2.  The patient will ambulate without her boot for 48 hours in order to decrease reliance upon the boot for ankle stabilization.3.  The patient will achieve left ankle dorsiflexion to neutral and plantar flexion to 45 degrees without significant increase in pain.4.  The patient will demonstrate 3/5 strength of the left ankle.5.  The patient will tolerate the completion of the 6-minute walk test without the use of a boot with minimal increase in pain. 

LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 6 WEEKS: 
1.  The patient will report 0/10 pain in the 48-hour period without the use of medication and without wearing her boot.2.  The patient will return to go through the work without the use of the walking boot with report of minimal increase in pain and discomfort. 

PROGNOSIS: 
Fair for above-stated goals with full compliance to home exercise program and therapy treatment as well as the patient motivation. 

PLAN: 
The patient to be seen three times a week for 6 weeks for the following1.  Therapeutic exercise with home exercise program in order to improve active range of motion and strength as functional activities.2.  Modalities to include ice and heat.3.  Manual therapy to include joint mobilization and soft tissue mobilization as tolerated.4.  Gait training in order to regain normal gait pattern and avoid any increase in additional joint involvement.I have explained the findings and the plan of care with the patient.  The patient states she understands and agrees to comply with treatment and plan of care.

Gen Med Progress Note - 9. 

Description: 
Multiple problems including left leg swelling, history of leukocytosis, joint pain left shoulder, low back pain, obesity, frequency with urination, and tobacco abuse. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check. 

OBJECTIVE: 
General  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.Vital Signs  Blood pressure  122/70.  Temperature  98.6.HEENT  Head  Normocephalic.  Ears  TMs intact.  Eyes  Pupils round, and equal.  Nose  Mucosa normal.  Throat  Mucosa normal.Lungs  Clear.Heart  Regular rate and rhythm.Abdomen  Soft and obese.Extremities  A lot of fluid in both legs, but especially the left leg is really swollen.  At least 2+ pedal edema.  The right leg just has a trace of edema.  She has pain in her low back with range of motion.  She has a lot of pain in her left shoulder with range of motion.  It is hard for her to get her hand behind her back.  She cannot get it up behind her head.  She has pain in the anterior left shoulder in that area. 

ASSESSMENT: 
1.  Multiple problems including left leg swelling.2.  History of leukocytosis.3.  Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.4.  Low back pain, chronic with obesity.5.  Obesity.6.  Frequency with urination.7.  Tobacco abuse. 

PLAN: 
1.  I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.  We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.  See her in two weeks or p.r.n.

Sample Name: 
Kyphoplasty - Consult. 

Description: 
The patient with an L5 compression fracture.is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty.  The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time. 

HISTORY: 
The patient is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty.  The patient is an 86-year-old female with an L5 compression fracture.The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time.  She was found to have an L5 compression fracture.  She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve.  Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing.  The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty.She denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  She does complain of back pain.  She has been wearing a back brace and corset.  She does not have weakness. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and gallbladder difficulties. 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
She has had multiple previous surgeries including bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and appendectomy.  She also has a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
She is on multiple medications currently. 

ALLERGIES: 
SHE IS ALLERGIC TO CODEINE, PENICILLIN, AND CEPHALOSPORINS. 

FAMILY HISTORY: 
The patient's parents are deceased. 

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: 
The patient lives locally.  She is a widow.  She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
GENERAL  The patient is an elderly frail white female in no distress.  LUNGS  Clear.  HEART  Sounds are regular.  ABDOMEN  She has a protuberant abdomen.  She has tenderness to palpation in the lumbosacral area.  Sciatic notch tenderness is not present.  Straight leg raise testing evokes back pain.  NEUROLOGICAL  She is awake, alert, and oriented.  Speech is intact.  Comprehension is normal.  Strength is intact in the upper extremities.  She has giveaway strength in the lower extremities.  Reflexes are diminished at the knees and ankles.  Gait is otherwise normal. 

DATA REVIEWED: 
Plain studies of the lumbar spine show an L5 compression fracture.  A CT scan has shown some healing of this fracture.  She has degenerative change at the L4-L5 level with a very slight spondylolisthesis at this level. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
The patient is a woman with a history of longstanding back, buttock, and leg pain.  She has a documented L5 compression fracture, which has not healed despite appropriate conservative treatments.  At this point, I believe the patient is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty.  I have discussed the procedure with her and I have reviewed with her and her family risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery.  Risks of surgery including but not limited to bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, failure to improve, spinal fluid leak, need for further surgery, cement extravasation, failure to improve her pain, and other potential complications have all been discussed.  The patient understands the issues involved.  She requested that we proceed with surgery as noted above and will come to the hospital for this surgery on 01/18/08.

CT Head - 2. 

Description: 
The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan.  The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving. 

REASON FOR CT SCAN: 
The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008.  I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm.  The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm.  There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle.  He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. 

ASSESSMENT: 
The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0. 

PLAN: 
I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.

Sample Name: 
Conversion Disorder. 

Description: 
The patient was referred after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder. 

REASON FOR REFERRAL: 
The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of Children's Hospital after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder.  I had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptoms and background at that time.  After his discharge, the patient was scheduled to see me for followup services.  This was a 90-minute intake that was completed on 10/10/2007 with the patient's mother.  I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts. 

PRESENTING PROBLEMS: 
Please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information.  The patient's mother reported that he continues with his conversion episodes.  She noted that they are occurring approximately 6 times a day.  They consist primarily of tremors, arching his back, and, by her report, doing some gang signs during the episode.  She reported that the conversion reactions had decreased after his hospitalization, and he had none for 3 days, but then, they began picking up again.  From information gathered from mother, it would suggest that she frequently does &quot;status checks,&quot; where she asks him how he is doing, and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reactions.  In terms of what she does when he has a conversion reaction, she reported that primarily that she tries to keep him safe.  She puts a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty.  She removes any furniture, she wraps his legs together so they do not knock together, she sits with him and she gives him attention and says &quot;calm down, breathe&quot; and after it is over, she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe.  She denied that she gives them any more attention.  I strongly encouraged her to stop doing status checks, as this likely is reinforcing the behavior.  I also noted that while he certainly needs to be kept safe, that she does not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior, and that over time we will teach him ways of coping with this independently.  In regards to his mood, she reported that his mood is quite good.  She denied any sadness or irritability.  She denied anhedonia.  She reports that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning.  He is going to bed at about 11, getting up at 8 or 9.  No changes in weight or eating were noted.  No changes in concentration, suicidal ideation, and any suicidal history was denied.  She denied symptoms of anxiety, although she did note that she thought he worried a little about going to school and some financial stress.  Other symptoms of psychopathology were denied. 

DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: 
The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery.  Mother reported that she did receive prenatal care.  The use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  She denied that he had any feeding or sleeping problems in the perinatal period.  She described him as a fussy and active baby, but he was described as a cuddly baby.  She noted that the pediatricians never expressed any concerns regarding his developmental milestones.  SHE REPORTED THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.  Serious injures or toileting problems were denied as were a history of seizures. 

FAMILY BACKGROUND: 
The patient currently lives with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40.  They have been together since 1994, and he is the only father figure that the patient has even known.  The father was previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11-year-old daughter who visits the patient's home every other weekend.  The patient's father's whereabouts are unknown.  There is no information on his family.  Mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she was about 3 months pregnant with the patient, and the patient has never met him.  As noted, there is no information on the paternal side of the family.  In terms of the mother's side of family, the maternal grandfather died in his 60s due to what mother described as &quot;hardening of the arteries,&quot; and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke.  There were 4 maternal aunts, one of them died at age 9 months from pneumonia, one of them died at 19 years old from what was described as a brain tumor, and there are 3 maternal uncles.  In terms of family relationships, it was reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parents, who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother's attention, and she noted this is difficult at times.  She reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together.  Mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home, but there is some marital conflict, and this is may be difficult for The patient, as it is carried on in Spanish, and he does not speak Spanish.  There also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter, as there are some concerns that her mother may be involved in drugs.  The mother reported that she attended high school, did not attend any college.  She denied learning problems.  She denied psychological problems or any drug/alcohol history.  In terms of the biological father, she reported he did not graduate from high school.  She did not know of learning problems, psychological problems.  She denied that he had a drug/alcohol history.  There is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncles as well as in the maternal grandfather.  It should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4-bedroom apartment, where privacy is very difficult. 

SOCIAL BACKGROUND: 
She reported that the patient is able to make and keep friends, but he enjoys lifting weights, skateboarding, and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing, he really enjoyed that.  I encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity, as this is good for discharge the stress, to encourage the weightlifting, as well as the skateboarding.  Mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in, which was at it sounds like by her description as some sort of boys' and girls' type of club.  Abuse of drugs or alcohol were denied.  The patient was not described as being sexually active. 

ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: 
The patient is currently in the 10th grade.  At present, he is on independent studies, which began after his hospitalization.  The mother reported that the teacher, who had come to school saw one of his episodes, and stated that, they would not want him to be attending school.  I spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it was probably not best for the patient to be on independent studies, that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment.  He has never had an episode at school, and he needs to be back with his peers, back in a regular environment, where he is under normal expectations.  I spoke with her regarding my concerns, regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day, and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation, where he is not getting his work done, and he gets himself in trouble.  Normally, he would be attending at High School.  The mother stated that she would contact them as well as check into possibly a 504-Plan.  She reported that he really does not to go back to High School.  He says, the &quot;kids are bad;&quot; however, she denied that he has any history of fighting.  She noted that he is stressed by the school, there have been some peer problems, possibly some bullying.  I noted these need to be addressed with the school, as she had not done so.  She stated that she would speak with a counselor.  She noted, however, that he has a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school.  She noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization.  His grades traditionally are C's.  She denied any Special Education Services. 

PREVIOUS COUNSELING: 
Denied. 

DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: 
Similar to my impression at the hospital, it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder.  It appears that there are multiple stressors in the family, and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction.  I am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment as quickly as possible.  My plan is to meet the patient at the next session to update the information regarding his functioning and to begin to teach him skills for reducing his stress and relaxing. 

DSM-IV DIAGNOSES: 
AXIS I  Conversion disorder (300.11).AXIS II  No diagnosis (V71.09).AXIS III  No diagnosis.AXIS IV  Problems with primary support group, educational problems, and peer problems.AXIS V  Global Assessment of Functioning equals 60.

Left undescended testis. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left undescended testis plus left inguinal hernia. 

PROCEDURES: 
Left inguinal hernia repair, left orchiopexy with 0.25% Marcaine, ilioinguinal nerve block and wound block at 0.5% Marcaine plain. 

ABNORMAL FINDINGS: 
A high left undescended testis with a type III epididymal attachment along with vas. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Less than 5 mL. 

FLUIDS RECEIVED: 
1100 mL of crystalloid. 

TUBES/DRAINS: 
No tubes or drains were used. 

COUNTS: 
Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. 

SPECIMENS: 
No tissues sent to Pathology. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General inhalational anesthetic. 

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: 
The patient is an 11-1/2-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the left.  The plan is for repair. 

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: 
The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Bradycardia.2.  Dizziness.3.  Diabetes.4.  Hypertension.5.  Abdominal pain. 

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 
Sick sinus syndrome.  The rest of her past medical history remained the same. 

PROCEDURES DONE: 
Permanent pacemaker placement after temporary internal pacemaker. 

HOSPITAL COURSE: 
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.  Dr. X was consulted.  A temporary intracardiac pacemaker was placed.  Consultation was requested to Dr. Y. He considered the need to have a permanent pacemaker after reviewing electrocardiograms and telemetry readings.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm with severe bradycardias, but all of them one to one transmission.  This was considered to be a sick sinus syndrome.  Permanent pacemaker was placed on 09/05/2007 with right atrium appendage and right ventricular apex electrode placement.  This is a Medtronic pacemaker.  After this, the patient remained with pain in the left side of the chest in the upper area as expected, but well controlled.  Right femoral artery catheter was removed.  The patient remained with good pulses in the right lower extremity with no hematoma.  Other problem was the patient's blood pressure, which on 09/05/2007 was found at 180/90.  Medication was adjusted to benazepril 20 mg a day.  Norvasc 5 mg was added as well.  Her blood pressure has remained better, being today 144/74 and 129/76. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 
Sick sinus syndrome.  The rest of her past medical history remained without change, which are1.  Diabetes mellitus.2.  History of peptic ulcer disease.3.  Hypertension.4.  Insomnia.5.  Osteoarthritis. 

PLAN: 
The patient is discharged home to continue her previous home medications, which are1.  Actos 45 mg a day.2.  Bisacodyl 10 mg p.o. daily p.r.n. constipation.3.

Thoracoscopy & Thoracotomy - Mesothelioma. 

Description: 
Left mesothelioma, focal.  Left anterior pleural-based nodule, which was on a thin pleural pedicle with no invasion into the chest wall. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left mesothelioma, focal. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left pleural-based nodule. 

PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 
1.  Left thoracoscopy.2.  Left mini thoracotomy with resection of left pleural-based mass. 

FINDINGS: 
Left anterior pleural-based nodule, which was on a thin pleural pedicle with no invasion into the chest wall. 

FLUIDS: 
800 mL of crystalloid. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Minimal. 

DRAINS, TUBES, CATHETERS: 
24-French chest tube in the left thorax plus Foley catheter. 

SPECIMENS: 
Left pleural-based nodule. 

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: 
The patient is a 59-year-old female with previous history of follicular thyroid cancer, approximately 40 years ago, status post resection with recurrence in the 1980s, who had a left pleural-based mass identified on chest x-ray.  Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: 
After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.

Sample Name: 
Consult - Knee Pain. 

Description: 
Patient with complaint of left knee pain.  Patient is obese and will be starting Medifast Diet. 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
Left knee pain. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
This is a 36-year-old white female who presents to the office today with a complaint of left knee pain.  She is approximately five days after a third Synvisc injection.  She states that the knee is 35% to 40 % better, but continues to have a constant pinching pain when she full weight bears, cannot handle having her knee in flexion, has decreased range of motion with extension.  Rates her pain in her knee as a 10/10.  She does alternate ice and heat.  She is using Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. and ibuprofen OTC p.r.n. with minimal relief. 

ALLERGIES: 
1.  PENICILLIN.2.  KEFLEX.3.  BACTRIM.4.  SULFA.5.  ACE BANDAGES. 

MEDICATIONS: 
1.  Toprol.2.  Xanax.3.  Advair.4.  Ventolin.5.  Tylenol No.  3.6.  Advil. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Will be starting the Medifast diet, has discussed this with her PCP, who encouraged her to have gastric bypass, but the patient would like to try this Medifast diet first.  Other than this, denies any further problems with her eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, nervous system, except what is noted above and below. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
VITAL SIGNS  Pulse 72, blood pressure 130/88, respirations 16, height 5 feet 6.5 inches.GENERAL  This is a 36-year-old white female who is A&O x3, in no apparent distress with a pleasant affect.  She is well developed, well nourished, appears her stated age.EXTREMITIES  Orthopedic evaluation of the left knee reveals there to be well-healed portholes.  She does have some medial joint line swelling.  Negative ballottement.  She has significant pain to palpation of the medial joint line, none of the lateral joint line.  She has no pain to palpation on the popliteal fossa.  Range of motion is approximately -5 degrees to 95 degrees of flexion.  It should be noted that she has extreme hyperextension on the right with 95+ degrees of flexion on the right.  She has a click with McMurray.  Negative anterior-posterior drawer.  No varus or valgus instability noted.  Positive patellar grind test.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Gait is stable and antalgic on the left. 

ASSESSMENT: 
1.  Osteochondral defect, torn meniscus, left knee.2.  Obesity. 

PLAN: 
I have encouraged the patient to work on weight reduction, as this will only benefit her knee.  I did discuss treatment options at length with the patient, but I think the best plan for her would be to work on weight reduction.  She questions whether she needs a total knee; I don't believe she needs total knee replacement.  She may, however, at some point need an arthroscopy.  I have encouraged her to start formal physical therapy and a home exercise program.  Will use ice or heat p.r.n.  I have given her refills on Tylenol No.  3, Flector patch, and Relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory.  She does have some abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, was started on Nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily.  She will follow up in our office in four weeks.  If she has not gotten any relief with formal physical therapy and the above-noted treatments, we will discuss with Dr. X whether she would benefit from another knee arthroscopy.  The patient shows a good understanding of this treatment plan and agrees.

Cholangiopancreatography (Endoscopic). 

Description: 
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy. 

PROCEDURE: 
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy. 

INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: 
Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla. 

MEDICATIONS: 
General anesthesia.The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn. 

FINDINGS: 
1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. NPO except ice chips today.2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.3. Follow up biopsies and cytology.

Joints are hurting all over and checkup. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
A 77-year-old white female who is having more problems with joint pain.  It seems to be all over decreasing her mobility, hands and wrists.  No real swelling but maybe just a little more uncomfortable than they have been.  The Daypro generic does not seem to be helping at all.  No fever or chills.  No erythema.She actually is doing better.  Her diarrhea now has settled down and she is having less urinary incontinence, less pedal edema.  Blood sugars seem to be little better as well.The patient also has gotten back on her Zoloft because she thinks she may be depressed, sleeping all the time, just not herself and really is disturbed that she cannot be more mobile in things.  She has had no polyuria, polydipsia, or other problems.  No recent blood pressure checks. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Little over a year ago, the patient was found to have lumbar discitis and was treated with antibiotics and ended up having debridement and instrumentation with Dr. XYZ and is doing really quite well.  She had a pulmonary embolus with that hospitalization. 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
She has also had a hysterectomy, salpingoophorectomy, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, two carpal tunnel releases.  She also has had a parathyroidectomy but still has had some borderline elevated calcium.  Also, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as well as diabetes.  She also has osteoporosis. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: 
The patient still smokes about a third of a pack a day, also drinks only occasional alcoholic drinks.  The patient is married.  She has three grown sons, all of which are very successful in professional positions.  One son is a gastroenterologist in San Diego, California. 

MEDICATIONS: 
Nifedipine-XR 90 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg half tablet b.i.d., lisinopril 20 mg daily, gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 0.1 mg daily, Miacalcin one spray in alternate nostrils daily, Ogen 0.625 mg daily, Daypro 600 mg t.i.d., also Lortab 7.5 two or three a day, also Flexeril occasionally, also other vitamin. 

ALLERGIES: 
She had some adverse reactions to penicillin, sulfa, perhaps contrast medium, and some mycins. 

FAMILY HISTORY: 
As far as heart disease there is none in the family.  As far as cancer two cousins had breast cancer.  As far as diabetes father and grandfather had type II diabetes.  Son has type I diabetes and is struggling with that at the moment. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
General  No fever, chills, or night sweats.  Weight stable.HEENT  No sudden blindness, diplopia, loss of vision, i.e., in one eye or other visual changes.  No hearing changes or ear problems.  No swallowing problems or mouth lesions.Endocrine  Hypothyroidism but no polyuria or polydipsia.  She watches her blood sugars.  They have been doing quite well.Respiratory  No shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis or breathing problems.Cardiovascular  No chest pain or chest discomfort.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, or heart attacks.GI  As mentioned, has had diarrhea though thought to be possibly due to Clostridium difficile colitis that now has gotten better.  She has had some irritable bowel syndrome and bowel abnormalities for years.GU  No urinary problems, dysuria, polyuria or polydipsia, kidney stones, or recent infections.  No vaginal bleeding or discharge.Musculoskeletal  As above.Hematological  She has had some anemia in the past.Neurological  No blackouts, convulsions, seizures, paralysis, strokes, or headaches. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
Vital Signs  Weight is 164 pounds.  Blood pressure  140/64.  Pulse  72.  Blood pressure repeated by me with the patient sitting taken on the right arm is 148/60, left arm 136/58; these are while sitting on the exam table.General  A well-developed pleasant female who is comfortable in no acute distress otherwise but she does move slowly.HEENT  Skull is normocephalic.  TMs intact and shiny with good auditory acuity to finger rub.  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation with extraocular movements intact.  Fundi benign.  Sclerae and conjunctivae were normal.Neck  No thyromegaly or cervical lymphadenopathy.  Carotids are 2+ and equal bilaterally and no bruits present.Lungs  Clear to auscultation and percussion with good respiratory movement.  No bronchial breath sounds, egophony, or rales are present.Heart  Regular rhythm and rate with no murmurs, gallops, rubs, or enlargement.  PMI normal position.  All pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally.Abdomen  Obese, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.Breasts  No predominant masses, discharge, or asymmetry.Pelvic Exam  Normal external genitalia, vagina and cervix.  Pap smear done.  Bimanual exam shows no uterine enlargement and is anteroflexed.  No adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is normal with soft brown stool Hemoccult negative.Extremities  The patient does appear to have some doughiness of all of the MCP joints of the hands and the wrists as well.  No real erythema.  There is no real swelling of the knees.  No new pedal edema.Lymph nodes  No cervical, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.Neurological  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally.  Cerebellar and motor function intact in all extremities.  Good vibratory and positional sense in all extremities and dermatomes.  Plantar reflexes are downgoing bilaterally. 

LABORATORY: 
CBC shows a hemoglobin of 10.5, hematocrit 35.4, otherwise normal.  Urinalysis is within normal limits.  Chem profile showed a BUN of 54, creatinine 1.4, glucose 116, calcium was 10.8, cholesterol 198, triglycerides 171, HDL 43, LDL 121, TSH is normal, hemoglobin A1C is 5.3. 

ASSESSMENT: 
1.  Arthralgias that are suspicious for inflammatory arthritis, but certainly seems to be more active and bothersome.  I think we need to look at this more closely.2.  Diarrhea that seems to have resolved.  Whether this is related to the above is unclear.3.  Diabetes mellitus type II, really fairly well controlled.4.  Hypertension, fair.5.  Hypercholesterolemia, could be a little better, particularly with the diabetes.  We may need to address that further but at this point I want to work on some of the other things.6.  Hyperparathyroidism that has been a persistent problem despite having the parathyroidectomy.  Whether this has anything to do with the arthralgias is unclear.7.  Osteoporosis, being treated.8.  Depression, possibly.  I agree with going back on the Zoloft for which she is taking 50 mg daily. 

PLAN: 
We will obtain an x-ray of both hands.  We will also obtain a sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, and have her see Dr. Mortensen.  Continue other medication.  We will also have her return in three months and we will go from there.  Continue all of her other medications at this point.

Impaired writing of name.CN Flattened right nasolabial fold only.Motor Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength.Sensory withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities.Coordination difficult to assess.Station Right pronator drift.Gait unremarkable.Reflexes 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally.General Exam unremarkable. 

INITIAL STUDIES: 
CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified). 

COURSE: 
MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer.

Sample Name: 
IV Procainamide Infusion. 

Description: 
Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction and IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Syncopal episodes with injury.  See electrophysiology consultation. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Normal electrophysiologic studies.2.  No inducible arrhythmia.3.  Procainamide infusion negative for Brugada syndrome. 

PROCEDURES: 
1.  Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction.2.  IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient gave informed consent for comprehensive electrophysiologic studies.  She received small amounts of intravenous fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation.  Then 1% lidocaine local anesthesia was used.  Three catheters were placed via the right femoral vein; 5-French catheters to the right ventricular apex and right atrial appendage; and a 6-French catheter to the His bundle.  Later in the procedure, the RV apical catheter was moved to RV outflow tract. 

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: 
Conduction intervals in sinus rhythm were normal.  Sinus cycle length 768 ms, PA interval 24 ms, AH interval 150 ms, HV interval 46 ms.  Sinus node recovery times were also normal at 1114 ms.  Corrected sinus node recovery time was normal at 330 ms.  One-to-one AV conduction was present to cycle length 480 ms, AH interval 240 ms, HV interval 54 ms.  AV nodal effective refractory period was normal, 440 ms at drive cycle length 600 ms.  RA-ERP was 250 ms.  With ventricular pacing, there was VA disassociation present.Since there was no evidence for dual AV nodal pathways, and poor retrograde conduction, isoproterenol infusion was not performed to look for SVT.Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed at both right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tracts.  Drive cycle length 600, 500, and 400 ms was used with triple extrastimuli down to troubling intervals of 180 ms, or refractoriness.  There was no inducible VT.  Longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding.  From the apex 400-600 with 2 extrastimuli were delivered, again with no inducible VT.Procainamide was then infused, 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  There were no ST segment changes.  HV interval after IV Procainamide remained normal at 50 ms. 

ASSESSMENT: 
Normal electrophysiologic studies.  No evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.  No inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for Brugada syndrome. 

PLAN: 
The patient will follow up with Dr. X.  She recently had an ambulatory EEG.  I will plan to see her again on a p.r.n. basis should she develop a recurrent syncopal episodes.  Reveal event monitor was considered, but not placed since she has only had one single episode.

Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 2. 

Description: 
Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary arteriographies, successful stenting of the left anterior descending diagonal. 

NAME OF PROCEDURE: 
Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary arteriographies, successful stenting of the left anterior descending diagonal. 

INDICATION: 
Recurrent angina.  History of coronary disease. 

TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: 
Standard Judkins, right groin. 

CATHETERS USED: 
6-French pigtail, 6-French JL4, 6-French JR4. 

ANTICOAGULATION: 
2000 of heparin, 300 of Plavix, was begun on Integrilin. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

STENT: 
For stenting we used a 6-French left Judkins guide.  Stent was a 275 x 13 Zeta. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives and risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of cardiac chamber, resection of an artery, arrhythmia requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, allergy, and need for vascular surgery.  All questions were answered and the patient decided to proceed. 

HEMODYNAMIC DATA: 
Aortic pressure was within physiologic range.  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve. 

ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA: 
1.  Ventriculogram  Left ventricle was of normal size and shape with normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.2.  Right coronary artery  Dominant.  There was a lesion in the proximal portion in the 60% range, insignificant disease distally.3.  Left coronary artery  The left main coronary artery showed insignificant disease.  The circumflex arose, showed about 30% proximally.  Left anterior descending arose and the previously placed stent was perfectly patent.  There was a large diagonal branch which showed 90% stenosis in its proximal portion.  There was a lesion in the 30% to 40% range even more proximal.I reviewed with the patient the options of medical therapy, intervention on the culprit versus bypass surgery.  He desired that we intervene.Successful stenting of the left anterior descending, diagonal.  The guide was placed in the left main.  We easily crossed the lesion in the diagonal branch of the left anterior descending.  We advanced, applied and post-dilated the 275 x 13 stent.  Final angiography showed 0% residual at the site of previous 90% stenosis.  The more proximal 30% to 40% lesion was unchanged. 

CONCLUSION: 
1.  Successful stenting of the left anterior descending/diagonal.  Initially there was 90% in the diagonal after stenting.  There was 0% residual.  There was a lesion a bit more proximal in the 40% range.2.  Left anterior descending stent remains patent.3.  30% in the circumflex.4.  60% in the right coronary.5.  Ejection fraction and wall motion are normal. 

PLAN: 
We have stented the culprit lesion.  The patient will receive a course of aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin, and statin therapy.  We used 6-French Angio-Seal in the groin.  All questions have been answered.  I have discussed the possibility of restenosis, need for further procedures.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary. 

Sample Name: 
Coarctation of Aorta. 

Description: 
Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta, dilated cardiomyopathy, bicuspid aortic valve, patent foramen ovale. 

HISTORY: 
The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%.  A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta. 

PROCEDURE: 
After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  There was good blood return from both the ports.Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications. 

DISCUSSION: 
Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm. 

DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.4.  Patent foramen ovale. 

INTERVENTION: 
Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta. 

MANAGEMENT: 
The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.  The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.

INDICATIONS: 
This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with a ruptured globe with full-thickness corneal laceration of the XXX eye. 

PROCEDURE: 
The risks and benefits of eye surgery were discussed at length with the patient, including bleeding, infection, astigmatism, cataract, re-operation, loss of vision, and loss of the eye. Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure and 0.12 forceps and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 11 o'clock. Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Viscoat cannula was used to sweep the incarcerated iris tissue from the wound. More Viscoat was injected to deepen the anterior chamber. A 10-0 nylon suture was used to place four sutures to close the corneal laceration. BSS was then injected to fill the anterior chamber and a small leak was noted at the inferior end of the wound. A fifth 10-0 nylon suture was then placed. The wound was packed and found to be watertight. The sutures were rotated, the wound was again checked and found to be watertight. A small amount of Viscoat was, again, injected to deepen the anterior chamber and the wound was swept to be sure there was no incarcerated uveal tissue. Several drops were placed in the XXX eye including Ocuflox, Pred Forte, Timolol 0.5%, Alphagan and Trusopt. An eye patch and shield were taped over the XXX eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia. (S)he was taken to the recovery area in good condition. There were no complications.

Presently, she has left hip pain and left shoulder pain.  No urinary frequency or dysuria.  No skin lesions.  She does have swelling to both lower extremities for the last several weeks.  She denies endocrinopathies.  Psychiatric issues include chronic depression. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
GENERAL  The patient is alert and responsive.EXTREMITIES  The left upper extremity, there is moderate swelling and ecchymosis to the brachial compartment.  She is diffusely tender over the proximal humerus.  She is unable to actively elevate her arm due to pain.  The neurovascular exam to the left upper extremity is otherwise intact with a 1+ radial pulse.  She does have chronic degenerative change to the MP and IP joints of both hands.  The left lower extremity, the thigh compartment is supple.  She has pain with log rolling tenderness over the greater trochanter.  The patient has pain with any attempt at hip flexion passively or actively.  The knee range of motion between 5 and 60 degrees with no point specific tenderness, no joint effusion, and an intact extensive mechanism.  She has 2 to 3+ bilateral pitting edema pretibially and pedally.  The patient has a weak motor response to the left lower extremity.  She has a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse.  Her sensory examination is intact plantarly and dorsally on the foot. 

RADIOGRAPHS: 
Left shoulder series was performed which identifies a three-part valgus-impacted left proximal humerus fracture with displacement of the greater tuberosity fragment approximately 1 cm.  There is no evidence of dislocation.  There was an AP pelvis as well as left hip series, which identify a nondisplaced valgus-impacted type 1 femoral neck fracture.  There is also evidence of severe degenerative disk disease with degenerative scoliosis of the LS spine.  There is evidence of previous surgical repair of the right proximal femur with an intact intramedullary nail. 

LABORATORY STUDIES: 
Patient's H&H is 13 and 38.7, white blood cell count is 6.9, and there are 198,000 platelets.  Electrolytes, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, CO2 is 27, BUN is 20, and creatinine 0.62.  Urinalysis, the urine is clear yellow, 0 to 2 white cells, and no bacteria. 

ASSESSMENT: 
1.  This is an 88-year-old household ambulator with a walker, status post fall with injuries to left shoulder and left hip.  The left shoulder fracture is a valgus-impacted proximal humerus fracture and the left hip is a nondisplaced type 1 femoral neck fracture.2.  Extensive medical history including coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on Plavix. 

PLAN: 
I have discussed this case with the emergency room physician as well as the patient.  Patient should be admitted to medical service for medical clearance for surgery of her left hip, which will include a percutaneous screw fixation.  Since the patient is on Plavix, I recommend that the Plavix be discontinued and should be placed on Lovenox 30 mg subcu q.d. which may be stopped 24 hours before the procedure.  She will need cardiology clearance, which would include an echo in advance of the procedure.  I have explained the nature of the injuries to the patient, the recommended surgical procedures, and the postop course and rehabilitation required thereafter.  She presently understands and agrees with the plan.

Iliopsoas Hematoma - 2. 

Description: 
Right iliopsoas hematoma with associated femoral neuropathy following cardiac catherization. 

CC: 
RLE weakness. 

HX: 
This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8.On 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization. This time he was found to have a single occlusion in the distal LAD with association inferior hypokinesis. Subsequent CK=1381 and CKMB=5.4 (elevated). The patient was amnestic to the event and for 10 days following the event. He was transferred to UIHC for cardiac electrophysiology study.

Euthymic with appropriate affect.CN unremarkable.Motor Hip flexion 3/5, Hip extension 5/5, Knee flexion5/5, Knee extension 2/5, Plantar flexion, extension, inversion and eversion 5/5. There was full strength thoughout BUE.Sensory decreased PP/Vib/LT/TEMP about anterior aspect of thigh and leg in a femoral nerve distribution.Coord poor and slowed HKS on right due to weakness.Station no drift or Romberg sign.Gait difficulty bearing weight on RLE.Reflexes 1+/1+ throughout BUE. 0/2 patellae. 2/2 archilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. 

COURSE: 
MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration.

Discharge Summary. 

Sample Name: 
Discharge Summary - 7. 

Description: 
Patient with fever of unknown origin. 

REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
Fever of unknown origin. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology. 

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone). 

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 
1.  The patient is going to go on ganciclovir 275 mg IV q.12 h. for approximately 3 weeks.2.  Advair 100/50, 1 puff b.i.d.3.  Ibuprofen p.r.n. and Tylenol p.r.n. for fever, and will continue her folic acid.4.  The patient will not restart for methotrexate for now.She is supposed to follow up with me on August 22, 2007 at 145 p.m.  She is also supposed to see Dr. XYZ in 2 weeks, and Dr. XYZ in 2-3 weeks.  She also has an appointment to see an ophthalmologist in about 10 days' time.  This was a prolonged discharge, more than 30 minutes were spent on discharging this patient.

IV Procainamide Infusion. 

Description: 
Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction and IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Syncopal episodes with injury.  See electrophysiology consultation. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Normal electrophysiologic studies.2.  No inducible arrhythmia.3.  Procainamide infusion negative for Brugada syndrome. 

PROCEDURES: 
1.  Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction.2.  IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient gave informed consent for comprehensive electrophysiologic studies.  She received small amounts of intravenous fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation.  Then 1% lidocaine local anesthesia was used.  Three catheters were placed via the right femoral vein; 5-French catheters to the right ventricular apex and right atrial appendage; and a 6-French catheter to the His bundle.  Later in the procedure, the RV apical catheter was moved to RV outflow tract. 

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: 
Conduction intervals in sinus rhythm were normal.  Sinus cycle length 768 ms, PA interval 24 ms, AH interval 150 ms, HV interval 46 ms.  Sinus node recovery times were also normal at 1114 ms.  Corrected sinus node recovery time was normal at 330 ms.  One-to-one AV conduction was present to cycle length 480 ms, AH interval 240 ms, HV interval 54 ms.  AV nodal effective refractory period was normal, 440 ms at drive cycle length 600 ms.  RA-ERP was 250 ms.  With ventricular pacing, there was VA disassociation present.Since there was no evidence for dual AV nodal pathways, and poor retrograde conduction, isoproterenol infusion was not performed to look for SVT.Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed at both right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tracts.  Drive cycle length 600, 500, and 400 ms was used with triple extrastimuli down to troubling intervals of 180 ms, or refractoriness.  There was no inducible VT.  Longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding.  From the apex 400-600 with 2 extrastimuli were delivered, again with no inducible VT.Procainamide was then infused, 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  There were no ST segment changes.  HV interval after IV Procainamide remained normal at 50 ms. 

ASSESSMENT: 
Normal electrophysiologic studies.  No evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.  No inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for Brugada syndrome. 

PLAN: 
The patient will follow up with Dr. X.  She recently had an ambulatory EEG.  I will plan to see her again on a p.r.n. basis should she develop a recurrent syncopal episodes.  Reveal event monitor was considered, but not placed since she has only had one single episode.

Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Fusion. 

Description: 
Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure.  Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis.  In addition to this, he had a large herniated disk at C3-C4 in the midline. 

PROCEDURE: 
Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure. 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
The patient placed in the supine position, the neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4.  Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially.  The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5.  It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously.  We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5.After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade.Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation.  We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments.  This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely.  We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well.  After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion.We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place.  The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within.  We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area.We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws.  X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate.The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue.  Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.  Blood loss less than about 200 mL.  No complications of the surgery.  Needle counts, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct.

Sample Name: 
Lumbar Puncture. 

Description: 
Possible CSF malignancy.  This is an 83-year-old woman referred for diagnostic lumbar puncture for possible malignancy by Dr. X.   The patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional.  She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak. 

REASON FOR VISIT: 
This is an 83-year-old woman referred for diagnostic lumbar puncture for possible malignancy by Dr. X. She is accompanied by her daughter. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient' daughter tells me that over the last month the patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional.  She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak.  She has not been having any headaches.  She has had a significant decrease in appetite.  She is known to have lung cancer, but Ms. Wilson does not know what kind.  According to her followup notes, it is presumed non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung.  The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008.  CT scan from 12/01/2009 shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, otherwise a normal head CT, no mass lesion.  I also reviewed the MRI from September 2009, which does not suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus and shows no mass lesion.Blood tests from 11/18/2009 demonstrate platelet count at 132 and INR of 1.0. 

MAJOR FINDINGS: 
The patient is a pleasant and cooperative woman who answers the questions the best she can and has difficulty moving her left arm and hand.  She also has pain in her left arm and hand at a level of 8-9/10. 

VITAL SIGNS: 
Blood pressure 126/88, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, and weight 95 pounds.I screened the patient with questions to determine whether it is likely she has abnormal CSF pressure and she does not have any of the signs that would suggest this, so we performed the procedure in the upright position. 

PROCEDURE: 
Lumbar puncture, diagnostic (CPT 62270). 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Possible CSF malignancy. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
To be determined after CSF evaluation. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Lumbar puncture. 

ANESTHESIA: 
Local with 2% lidocaine at the L4-L5 level. 

SPECIMEN REMOVED: 
15 cc of clear CSF. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
None. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: 
I explained the procedure, its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the patient and her daughter.  The patient' daughter remained present throughout the procedure.  The patient provided written consent and her daughter signed as witness to the consent.I located the iliac crest and spinous processes before the procedure and determined the level I planned for the puncture.  During the procedure, I spoke constantly with the patient to explain what was happening and to warn when there might be pain or discomfort.  The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine solution with the patient seated on the chair leaning forward with her face resting on the exam table.  Using local anesthetic and aseptic technique, I inserted a 20-gauge spinal needle at the L4-L5 interspace and 15 cc of CSF was collected without difficulty.The patient tolerated the procedure well. 

ASSESSMENT: 
White blood cells 1, red blood cells 54, glucose 59, protein 51, Gram stain negative, bacterial culture negative after three days, and remaining tests pending.

Consult - History and Phy. 

Sample Name: 
Dietary Consult - Gestational Diabetes. 

Description: 
Dietary consultation for gestational diabetes. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work. 

OBJECTIVE: 
Today's weight  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established. 

ASSESSMENT: 
Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time. 

PLAN: 
The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.

Foreign Body Removal - Foot. 

Description: 
Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue.  This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Foreign body, right foot. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Foreign body in the right foot. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue. 

ANESTHESIA: 
TIVA and local. 

HISTORY: 
This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review. 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear &quot;S&quot;-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.  He was given crutches.  He was discharged in stable condition.

Tracheostomy. 

Description: 
Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. 

OPERATION PERFORMED: 
Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube. 

INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: 
The patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the National Tennessee, and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement.  However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.

Cranial Vault Reconstruction. 

Description: 
Anterior cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital bar advancement. 

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: 
Right coronal synostosis with left frontal compensatory bossing causing plagiocephaly. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Syndromic craniosynostosis. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Syndromic craniosynostosis. 

TITLE OF OPERATION: 
Anterior cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital bar advancement. 

SPECIMENS: 
None. 

DRAINS: 
One subgaleal drain exiting from the left posterior aspect of wound. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was started, the patient was placed on the operating table in supine position with the head held on a horseshoe-shaped headrest and the head was prepped and draped down the routine manner.  Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.

Sample Name: 
Selective Coronary Angiography & Angioplasty. 

Description: 
Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.  Acute non-ST-elevation MI. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS: 
Acute non-ST-elevation MI. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY: 
The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty. 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all. 

CONTRAST: 
Isovue-370, 120 mL. 

FLUORO TIME: 
9.4 minutes. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
30 mL. 

HEMODYNAMICS: 
Aorta 185/54.Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Acute appendicitis. 

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: 
Laparoscopic appendectomy. 

INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: 
Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix. 

OPERATIVE NOTE: 
The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area.  The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.  Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. 

PROCEDURE  PERFORMED: 
Left unicompartmental knee replacement. 

COMPONENTS USED: 
Biomet size medium femoral component size B tibial tray and a 3 mm polyethylene component. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

TOURNIQUET TIME: 
59 minutes. 

BLOOD LOSS: 
Minimal. 

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
A 55-year-old female who had previously undergone a Biomet Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement on the right side.  She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity and will be maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  Prior to closure, the posterior capsule was injected with the joint cocktail.

Cystoscopy, bladder biopsies, and fulguration.  Bladder lesions with history of previous transitional cell bladder carcinoma, pathology pending. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Bladder lesions with history of previous transitional cell bladder carcinoma. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Bladder lesions with history of previous transitional cell bladder carcinoma, pathology pending. 

OPERATION PERFORMED: 
Cystoscopy, bladder biopsies, and fulguration. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General. 

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: 
This is a 73-year-old gentleman who was recently noted to have some erythematous, somewhat raised bladder lesions in the bladder mucosa at cystoscopy.  He was treated for a large transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with TURBT in 2002 and subsequently underwent chemotherapy because of pulmonary nodules.  He has had some low grade noninvasive small tumor recurrences on one or two occasions over the past 18 months.  Recent cystoscopy raises suspicion of another recurrence. 

OPERATIVE FINDINGS: 
The entire bladder was actually somewhat erythematous with mucosa looking somewhat hyperplastic particularly in the right dome and lateral wall of the bladder.  Scarring was noted along the base of the bladder from the patient's previous cysto TURBT.  Ureteral orifice on the right side was not able to be identified.  The left side was unremarkable. 

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: 
The patient was taken to the operating room.  He was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered after which the patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The genitalia and lower abdomen were prepared with Betadine and draped subsequently.  The urethra and bladder were inspected under video urology equipment (25 French panendoscope) with the findings as noted above.  Cup biopsies were taken in two areas from the right lateral wall of the bladder, the posterior wall of bladder, and the bladder neck area.  Each of these biopsy sites were fulgurated with Bugbee electrodes.  Inspection of the sites after completing the procedure revealed no bleeding and bladder irrigant was clear.  The patient's bladder was then emptied.  Cystoscope removed and the patient was awakened and transferred to the postanesthetic recovery area.  There were no apparent complications, and the patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was less than 15 mL.

Labs done on January 28, 2008, showed BUN of 23 and creatinine of 0.9.  Liver enzymes checked on January 17, 2008, were unremarkable.  CBC done on January 26, 2008, showed WBC of 19.8, hemoglobin of 10.7, hematocrit of 30.8, and platelet count of 515,000.  Chest x-ray from yesterday shows right-sided Port-A-Cath, diffuse right lung parenchymal and pleural infiltration without change, mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 

ASSESSMENT: 
1.  Mesothelioma versus primary lung carcinoma, two separate reports as for the two separate biopsies done several weeks apart.2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.4.  Malignant pleural effusion, status post surgery as stated above.5.  Anemia of chronic disease. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1.  Compare the slides from the previous biopsy done in December at XYZ Hospital with recurrent pleural nodule biopsy slides.  I have discussed regarding this with Dr. Y in Pathology here at Methodist XYZ Hospital.  I will try to obtain the slides for comparison from XYZ Hospital for comparison and immunohistochemical staining.2.  I will also discuss with Dr. X and also with intervention radiologist at XYZ Hospital regarding the exact sites of the two biopsies.3.  Once the results of the above are available, I will make further recommendations regarding treatment.  The patient has significantly decreased performance status with dyspnea on exertion and is being planned for transfer to Triumph Hospital for rehab, which I agree with.4.  Continue present care.Discussed regarding the above in great details with the patient and his wife and daughter and answered the questions to their satisfaction.  They clearly understand the above.  They also understand his very poor performance status at this time, and the risks and benefits of delaying chemotherapy due to this.

ASSESSMENT: 
AF is a 50-year-old African-American man with abdominal pain and distention, obstipation, and vomiting.  The differential diagnosis includes paralytic ileus and mechanical obstruction.  Paralytic ileus, which is characterized by absence of bowel sounds, gas scattered in the GI tract, dilation of the entire bowel, and a recent abdominal surgery, is unlikely in this case.  AF is more likely suffering from a bowel obstruction  he has multiple risk factors (past abdominal surgery, multiple episodes of obstruction from adhesions) and symptoms and signs (bowel sounds, vomiting) consistent with obstruction.Mechanical bowel obstruction can be caused by1.  Adhesions (most cases)  typically from prior surgeries.2.  Hernias (second most common cause).3.  Tumors (15% of cases)  rare in small intestine; most common cause of large intestine obstruction.4.  Intussusception (especially in kids).5.  Volvulus (especially in elderly).6.  Obturation  fecal impactions, gallstone ileus, parasitic infections.7.  Inflammatory lesions  TB, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, amebiasis.8.  Vascular obstruction  embolism, increased venous pressure, hypercoagulability, vascular disease; especially in elderly.Given the patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and adhesions causing small bowel obstruction, AF's obstruction is most likely caused by adhesions.One question to answer in any patient presenting with bowel obstruction is whether the obstruction is in the small or large intestine.  In small bowel obstruction, the pain is sharp and frequent, with early vomiting and electrolyte imbalance.  In contrast, large bowel obstruction may present in elderly patients without vomiting, and typically without hernias or a history of abdominal surgery.  Radiographic studies can definitively locate the site of the obstruction.  In this patient, though the radiographic evidence was equivocal, the presence of vomiting and the quality and frequency of his pain suggested small bowel obstruction. 

PLAN: 
There has been a great deal of debate about the best way to treat patients with mechanical obstruction.  I will focus on the question of whether a patient should be managed conservatively or with an operation.  This question is vital because mechanical obstruction may lead to strangulation and perforation, life-threatening consequences.  There is no reliable way to determine whether the patient is already suffering from strangulated bowel, and next to impossible to predict which patients will suffer from strangulation.Patients that have hernias are sent immediately to the operating room for a repair; the surgeon will resect any nonviable bowel.  For patients suffering from an obstruction due to adhesions, the decision becomes difficult.  Fifteen percent of these patients may have strangulating obstruction.  Simple (nonstrangulating) bowel obstruction typically presents with intermittent, colicky pain.  Strangulating obstruction, in contrast, usually presents with steady unrelenting pain.  Other signs include a palpable mass, increased temperature and heart rate, and lab studies indicating acute inflammation.Several studies have examined the ability of these signs to predict when strangulation is present.  After a study of 238 patients with small bowel obstruction, Stewardson et al. (1978) suggest that physicians, instead of considering individual signs, look at a combination of &quot;classic findings&quot; including leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and localized tenderness.  They recommend conservative treatment only for patients with none or only one of these signs.  Ninety percent of patients with strangulated bowel had two or more signs.  Bizer et al. (1981), on the other hand, found no correlation between these signs and the presence of strangulation.  They did find a correlation with age, feculent vomiting, peristaltitic sounds, and a white cell count above 18,000.It is clear that there are no absolute guidelines determining whether a patient can be treated conservatively or must get an operation.  Improvements in imaging techniques in the recent past have aided in these critical decisions.  Computed tomography can frequently be used to diagnose strangulation, however in the majority of cases misses the diagnosis.  Apparently, the decision to operate ultimately falls on the judgment of the surgeon who must take into account all of the findings in combination.The operative treatment of mechanical obstruction is removing the obstruction resecting nonviable bowel, and creating a bypass if necessary.  Conservative treatment primarily includes decompression, rehydration, and frequent monitoring.  The physician must also decide on what type of tube should be used to decompress, and how long the nonoperative treatment will be attempted before resorting to surgery.  The question of the tube has been a controversy for years, some advocating the nasogastric tube for all patients, others advocating a nasointestinal tube for distal obstructions.  Maglinte et al. (2001) explain that nasointestinal tubes are more effective at decompressing distal obstructions, and suggest that physicians use a multipurpose tube that can be used as a nasogatric tube, a nasointestinal tube, and a diagnostic tool (can provide route for enteroclysis).  Nasogastric tubes are especially unable to decompress distal distention in patients with a competent pyloric sphincter.Finally, the length of the trial period of nonoperative management is also debatable.  Seror et al. (1993) suggest a 5-day trial to allow time for spontaneous resolution, and report a 73% success rate in a study of patients with a history of bowel surgery.  In contrast, Deutsch et al. (1989) suggest only a 24 hour trial of conservative therapy, and only for patients with partial obstruction.  Again, it appears as though this decision presently is at the discretion of the surgeon caring for the patient.In the case of patient AF, his findings made the decision to operate particularly difficult.  He was clearly tachycardic; his WBC was elevated, but not above 18,000.  His abdominal pain was steady and unrelenting, and could be localized to the LLQ, but he was afebrile.  His abdominal CT was consistent with small bowel obstruction, but not definitive.  In the end, based on the team's desire to avoid another abdominal surgery that could lead to more adhesions and another obstruction, we chose conservative management, with nasogastric tube decompression, rehydration, and close observation.

Description: 
A 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up. 

MEDICATIONS: 
Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra. 

ALLERGIES: 
She has no known medicine allergies. 

OBJECTIVE: 
Vitals  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.HEENT  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.Neck  Supple without adenopathy.Lungs  Clear. 

ASSESSMENT:

PROCEDURE: 
Laparoscopy with ablation of endometriosis. 

DIAGNOSIS: 
Endometriosis. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
None. 

FINDINGS: 
Allen-Masters window in the upper left portion of the cul-de-sac, bronze lesions of endometriosis in the central portion of the cul-de-sac as well as both the left uterosacral ligament, flame lesions of the right uterosacral ligament approximately 5 mL of blood tinged fluid in the cul-de-sac.  Normal tubes and ovaries, normal gallbladder, smooth liver edge. 

PROCEDURE: 
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia.  She was put in the dorsal lithotomy position, and the perineum and abdomen were prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Subumbilical area was injected with Marcaine, and a Veress needle was placed subumbilically through which approximately 2 L of CO2 were inflated.  Scalpel was used to make a subumbilical incision through which a 5-mm trocar was placed.  Laparoscope was inserted through the cannula and the pelvis was visualized.  Under direct visualization, two 5-mm trocars were placed in the right and left suprapubic midline.  Incision sites were transilluminated and injected with Marcaine prior to cutting.  Hulka manipulator was placed on the cervix.  Pelvis was inspected and blood tinged fluid was aspirated from the cul-de-sac.  The beginnings of an Allen-Masters window in the left side of the cul-de-sac were visualized along with bronze lesions of endometriosis.  Some more lesions were noted above the left uterosacral ligament.  Flame lesions were noted above the right uterosacral ligament.  Tubes and ovaries were normal bilaterally with the presence of a few small paratubal cysts on the left tube.  There was a somewhat leathery appearance to the ovaries.  The lesions of endometriosis were ablated with the argon beam coagulator, as was a region of the Allen-Masters window.  Pelvis was irrigated and all operative sites were hemostatic.  No other abnormalities were visualized and all instruments were moved under direct visualization.  Approximately 200 mL of fluid remained in the abdominal cavity.  All counts were correct and the skin incisions were closed with 2-0 Vicryl after all CO2 was allowed to escape.  The patient was taken to the recovery in stable condition.

INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: 
This is a case of a very pleasant 32-year-old Caucasian male who had been experiencing posterior neck discomfort and was shooting basketball last week, during which time he felt a pop.  Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening.  About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm.  The patient also noted shuffling gait.  The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation.  Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine.  MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes.  Based on these findings, I recommended decompression.  The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him.  Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient.  There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics.  However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation.  This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed.  There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear.  There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid.  The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation.  The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  No monitoring leads were placed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders.  Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified.  Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur.  The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur.  The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4.  There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side.  By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed.  Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder.  With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place.  An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws.  The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution.  Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch.  Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain.  C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.

Heart Catheterization - 2. 

Description: 
Right heart catheterization.   Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
Right heart catheterization. 

INDICATION: 
Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy. 

PROCEDURE: 
After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance.  Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed.  An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained.  The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition. 

FINDINGS: 
Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8.  Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%.  Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22. 

IMPRESSION: 
Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance. 

PLAN: 
Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor.  The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy.  We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d.  We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily.  We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy.  As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil.

Otitis Media - Discharge Summary. 

Description: 
Fever, otitis media, and possible sepsis. 

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Fever.2.  Otitis media.3.  Possible sepsis. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. 

LABORATORY FINDINGS: 
He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest. 

HOSPITAL COURSE: 
The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 1345 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning. 

CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: 
He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing. 

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Bilateral otitis media.2.  Fever. 

PLAN: 
Recommended discharge.  No restrictions in diet or activity.  He was continued Omnicef 125 mg/5 mL one teaspoon p.o. once daily and instructed to follow up with Dr. X, his primary doctor, on the following Tuesday.  Parents were instructed also to call if new symptoms occurred or he had return if difficulties with breathing or increased lethargy.

A 71 y/o RHM ,with a history of two strokes ( one in 11/90 and one in 11/91), had been in a stable state of health until 12/31/92 when he became confused, and displayed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms resolved within hours and recurred the following day. He was then evaluated locally and HCT revealed an old right parietal stroke. Carotid duplex scan revealed a &quot;high grade stenosis&quot; of the RICA. Cerebral Angiogram revealed 90%RICA and 50%LICA stenosis. He was then transferred to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion persisted and he was evaluated by Neurology on 1/8/93 and transferred to Neurology on 1/11/93. 

PMH: 
1)cholecystectomy. 2)inguinal herniorrhaphies, bilaterally. 3)ETOH abuse 3-10 beers/day. 4)Right parietal stroke 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis (Leg worse than arm). 5) 2nd stoke in distant past of unspecified type. 

MEDS: 
None on admission. 

FHX: 
Alzheimer's disease and stroke on paternal side of family. 

SHX:

BP137/70 HR81 RR13 O2Sat 95% Afebrile.MS Oriented to city and month, but did not know date or hospital. Naming and verbal comprehension were intact. He could tell which direction Iowa City and Des Moines were from Clinton and remembered 2-3 objects in two minutes, but both with assistance only. Incorrectly spelled &quot;world&quot; backward, as &quot;dlow.&quot;CN unremarkable except neglects left visual field to double simultaneous stimulation.Motor Deltoids 4+/4-, biceps 5-/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, HF4+/4-, HE 4+/4+, Hamstrings 5-/5-, AE 5-/5-, AF 5-/5-.Sensory intact PP/LT/Vib.Coord dysdiadochokinesis on RAM, bilaterally.Station dyssynergic RUE on FNF movement.Gait NDReflexes 2+/2+ throughout BUE and at patellae. Absent at ankles. Right plantar was flexor; and Left plantar was equivocal. 

COURSE: 
CBC revealed normal Hgb, Hct, Plt and WBC, but Mean corpuscular volume was large at 103FL (normal 82-98). Urinalysis revealed 20+WBC. GS, TSH, FT4, VDRL, ANA and RF were unremarkable. He was treated for a UTI with amoxacillin. Vitamin B12 level was reduced at 139pg/ml (normal 232-1137). Schillings test was inconclusive dure to inability to complete a 24-hour urine collection. He was placed on empiric Vitamin B12 1000mcg IM qd x 7 days; then qMonth. He was also placed on Thiamine 100mg qd, Folate 1mg qd, and ASA 325mg qd. His ESR and CRP were elevated on admission, but fell as his UTI was treated.EEG showed diffuse slowing and focal slowing in the theta-delta range in the right temporal area. HCT with contrast on 1/19/93 revealed a gyriform enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe consistent with a new infarct; and an old right parietal hypodensity (infarct). His confusion was ascribed to the UTI in the face of old and new strokes and Vitamin B12 deficiency. He was lost to follow-up and did not undergo carotid endarterectomy.

Sample Name: 
Psychiatric Evaluation - 3. 

Description: 
Psychiatric evaluation for ADHD, combined type. 

IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT: 
ABCD is an 8-year-old Hispanic male currently in the second grade. 

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
ABCD presents to this visit with his mother, Xyz, and her significant other, Pqr.  Circumstances leading to this admission  In the past, ABCD has been diagnosed and treated for ADHD, combined type, and has been on Concerta 54 mg one p.o. q.8h.  Since he has been on the 54 mg, mother has concerns because he has not been sleeping well at night, consistently he is staying up until 1200 or 100, and he is not eating the noonday meal and not that much for supper.  ABCD is also complaining of headaches when he takes the medication.  Mother reports that on the weekends he is off the medication.  She does notice that his sisters become more irritated with him and say he is either hitting them or bothering them and he will say, &quot;It's an accident.&quot;  She sees him as impulsive on the weekends, but is not sure if this just isn't &quot;all boy.&quot;Mother reports ABCD has been on medication since kindergarten.  Currently, the teachers say he is able to pay attention and he is well behaved in school.  Prior to being on medication, there were issues with the teachers saying he was distractible and had difficulty paying attention.He had a psychological evaluation done on 07/16/06 by Dr. X, in which he was diagnosed with ADHD, combined type; ODD; rule out depressive disorder, NOS; rule out adjustment disorder with depressed mood; and rule out adjustment disorder with mixed features of conduct.  He also has seen XYZ, LCSW, in the past for outpatient therapy.ABCD's mother, A, as well as her significant other, R, and his teachers are not convinced that he needs his medication and would like to either trial him off or trial him on a lower dose. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Sleep  As stated before, he is having much difficulty on a consistent basis falling asleep.  It is 1200 to 100 a.m. before he falls to sleep.  When he was on the 36 mg of Concerta, he was able to fall asleep without difficulty.  On the weekends, he is also having difficulty falling asleep, even though he is not taking the medication.Appetite  He will eat breakfast and supper, but not much lunch, if any at all.  He has not lost weight that mother is aware of, nor is he getting more sick than normal.Mood control  Mother reports he has not been aggressive since he has been on the medication, nor is he getting in trouble at school for aggression or misbehavior.  The only exception to this is he gets in occasional fights with his sisters.  ABCD denies visual or auditory hallucinations or racing thoughts.  He reports his thoughts are sometimes bad because he says sometimes he thinks of the &quot;S&quot; word.Energy  Mother reports a lot of energy.Pain  ABCD denies any pain in his body.Suicidal or homicidal thoughts  He denies suicidal thoughts or plan to hurt himself or anyone else. 

PAST TREATMENT AND/OR MEDICATIONS:

FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
Mother reports that on her side of the family she is currently being assessed for mood disorder/bipolar.  She reports she has significant moodiness episodes and believes in the past she has had a manic episode.  She is currently not on medication.  She does not know of anyone else in her family, with the exception of she said her father's behavior was &quot;weird.&quot;  Biological father's side of the family, mother reports father was very impulsive.  He had anger issues.  He had drug and alcohol issues.  He was in jail for three years for risky behavior.  There was also domestic violence when mother was married to father. 

FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: 
Biological mother and father were married for five years.  They divorced when ABCD was 2-1/2 years of age.  Currently, father has been deported back to Mexico.  He last saw ABCD in March 2006 for one day when they went down to AAAA.  He does call on special holidays and his birthday.  Contact is brief, but so far has been consistent.  Mother is currently seeing R, a significant other, and has been seeing him for the last seven months.  ABCD had a good relationship with R.  ABCD has an older sister, M, age 9, who they describe as very gifted and creative without attention issues or oppositional issues, and a younger sister, S, age 7, who mother describes as &quot;all wisdom.&quot;. 

PREGNANCY: 
Mother reports her pregnancy was within normal limits as well as the labor and birth; although, she was exposed to domestic violence while ABCD was in utero.  She did not use drugs or alcohol while she was pregnant. 

DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES: 
Developmental milestones were all met on time, although ABCD has had speech therapy since he was young. 

PHYSICAL ABUSE: 
Mother and ABCD deny any history of physical or sexual abuse or emotional abuse, with the exception of exposure to domestic violence when he was very young, age 2 and before. 

DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS: 
Mother reports ABCD was a very cuddly infant and could sleep well.  As a toddler, he was all over the place, climbing and always busy.  Elementary school  In kindergarten, the teacher said it was very emphatic that he needed medication because he could not focus or sit still or listen.  ABCD has no history of fire setting or abuse to animals.  He does not lie more than other kids his age and he does not have any issues with stealing. 

PAST DRUG AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: 
Noncontributory.

ABCD has no known drug allergies.  He has no history of heart murmur, heart defect of other heart problems.  No history of asthma, seizures or head injuries.  He no medical diagnosis and he has ever spent an overnight in a medical hospital. 

SCHOOL: 
When I asked ABCD whether he likes school, he stated, &quot;No.&quot;  His grades are okay, per mother.  He does have an IEP for the ADHD, but she does not believe he has a learning disability.  Behavior problems  He currently is not having any behavior problems in the school.  He reports he does not get along with his teachers because they tell him what to do.  Strengths  He reports he loves to read and he can focus and concentrate on his reading and he dislikes centers.

TALENTS AND GIFTS: 
He is good at basketball, video games, and reading books. 

MENTAL STATUS EXAM: 
This was a very long appointment, approximately two hours in length, due to mother and significant other had many questions.  ABCD kept himself occupied throughout and was very well behaved throughout the session.  He had some significant memory responses in that he remembered the last holiday was Martin Luther King Day, which is somewhat unusual for a child his age, but he could only recall one of three items after five minutes.  Distractibility and attention  He, at times, was very mildly distracted, but otherwise did not appear hyperactive.  His judgment was adequate.  When asked what he would do if there was a fire in his house, he said, &quot;Get out!&quot;  Insight was poor to adequate.  Fund of information was good.  When asked who the president was, he said, &quot;George Washington.&quot; Intelligence is probably average to above average.  Speech was normal.  He had some difficulty with abstract thinking.  He could not see any similarities between an orange and an apple, but was able to see similarities of wheels between an airplane and a bicycle.  On serial 7's he could do 100 minus 7, but then unable to subtract any of the others, but he completed serial 3's very rapidly.  When given three commands in a row, he used his left hand instead of his right hand, but followed the last two commands correctly.  Appearance was casual.  Hygiene was good.  Attitude was cooperative.  Speech was normal.  Psychomotor was between normal and slightly hyperactive.  Orientation was x2.  Attention/concentration was intact.  Memory was intact at times and then had some memory recall problems with three words.  Mood was euthymic.  Affect was bright.  He has no suicidal or homicidal/violence risks.  Perceptions were normal.  Thought process logical.  Thought content normal.  Disassociation none.  Sleep  He is having some insomnia.  Appetite/eating are decreased. 

STRENGTHS AND SUPPORTS: 
He has a strong support system in his mother, grandmother, and mother's significant other, Richard.  He has good health.  He has shown gain from past treatment.  He has a sense of humor and a positive relationship with his mother and her significant other, as well as good school behavior. 

CLINICAL IMPRESSION: 
It is difficult to know until he is trialed off medication whether or not he truly has attention deficit or oppositional behavior, due to mother has since the last appointment created a lot of structure in her life.  She has implemented some parenting techniques, Love and Logic by Foster Cline and 1-2-3 Magic by Dr. P, in which she is carrying out pretty consistently and it seems that ABCD is doing much better with his behavior since she has instituted these.  He is also doing well in school, but he is on medication when he is in school.  The medication is causing him some distress in that he is not sleeping at night.  He could have an underlying mood disorder and that is what is manifesting with the insomnia, due to he does not receive the medication on the weekends and still has problems going to sleep.  There is a possibility ABCD could have an underlying mood disorder with mother being assessed for bipolar and due to the history of father's risk-taking behaviors, drug and alcohol use, as well as impulsivity.  Also mother reports that if things get too noisy or too chaotic around ABCD, he will report that his head hurts or that he feels there is too much going into his head. 

DIAGNOSES: 
 

AXIS  I: 
At this point in time we are in an investigative time, so will give  312.9  Disruptive behavior disorder, NOS (not otherwise specified).  314.01 ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), combined, by history.  Rule out mood disorder. 

AXIS  II: 
None. 

AXIS III: 
None. 

AXIS IV: 
Problems with primary support group. 

AXIS V: 
GAF  65, current. 

PROGNOSIS: 
Good, due to mother and significant other are very invested in ABCD's care. 

PLAN: 
Trial off the Concerta.  I gave mother the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales thatscreen for ADHD, as well as anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and mood.  We will have mother and Richard, as well as teachers, screen him on medication and off medication.  Encouraged mother to continue with the Love and Logic and 1-2-3 Magic parenting techniques.Follow up will be in three weeks.  The parents were given the option that they may cancel the appointment if he his stable off medication.  If he has difficulty being off medication, before any more prescriptions will be written, we would want to see the assessments from the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales.

1.  Posttraumatic nasal deformity.2.  Nasal obstruction.3.  Nasal valve collapse.4.  Request for cosmetic change with excellent appearance of nose. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Posttraumatic nasal deformity.2.  Nasal obstruction.3.  Nasal valve collapse.4.  Request for cosmetic change with excellent appearance of nose. 

OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: 
1.  Left ear cartilage graft.2.  Repair of nasal vestibular stenosis using an ear cartilage graft.3.  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.4.  Left inferior turbinectomy. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General via endotracheal tube. 

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: 
The patient is with symptomatic nasal obstruction and fixed nasal valve collapse following a previous nasal fracture and attempted repair.  We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her questions asked and answered.  Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had questions asked and answered.  Informed consent was obtained. 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered.  The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length.  The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

FINDINGS: 
Male infant in cephalic presentation with anteflexed head, Apgars were 2 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes, 9 at 10 minutes, and weight 7 pounds 8 ounces.  Normal uterus, tubes, and ovaries were noted. 

INDICATIONS: 
The patient is a 31-year-old gravida 5, para 4 female, who presented to repeat cesarean section at term.  The patient has a history of 2 previous cesarean sections and she desires a repeat cesarean section, additionally she desires permanent fertilization.  The procedure was described to the patient in detail including possible risks of bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs, and the possible need for further surgery and informed consent was obtained. 

PROCEDURE NOTE: 
The patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to elevate the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using the Bovie.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.The peritoneum was identified and entered using Metzenbaum scissors; this incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and entered sharply using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was reinserted.  The lower uterine segment was incised in a transverse fashion using the scalpel and extended using bandage scissors as well as manual traction.Clear fluid was noted.  The infant was subsequently delivered using a Kelly vacuum due to anteflexed head and difficulty in delivering the infant's head without the Kelly.  The nose and mouth were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was subsequently handed to the awaiting nursery nurse.  The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord noted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was repaired in 2 layers using 0 chromic sutures.  Hemostasis was visualized.  Attention was turned to the right fallopian tube, which was grasped with Babcock clamp using a modified Pomeroy method, a 2 cm of segment of tube ligated x2, transected and specimen was sent to pathology.  Attention was then turned to the left fallopian tube, which was grasped with Babcock clamp again using a modified Pomeroy method, a 2 cm segment of tube was ligated x2 and transected.  Hemostasis was visualized bilaterally.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen, both fallopian tubes were visualized and were noted to be hemostatic.  The uterine incision was reexamined and it was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was copiously irrigated.  The rectus muscles were reapproximated in the midline using 3-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 0 Vicryl suture, the subcutaneous layer was closed with 3-0 plain gut, and the skin was closed with staples.  Sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was stable at the completion of the procedure and was subsequently transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Sample Name: 
Dietary Consult - 1. 

Description: 
Elevated cholesterol and is on medication to lower it. 

SUBJECTIVE: 
His brother, although he is a vegetarian, has elevated cholesterol and he is on medication to lower it.  The patient started improving his diet when he received the letter explaining his lipids are elevated.  He is consuming less cappuccino, quiche, crescents, candy from vending machines, etc.  He has started packing his lunch three to four times per week instead of eating out so much.  He is exercising six to seven days per week by swimming, biking, running, lifting weights one and a half to two and a half hours each time.  He is in training for a triathlon.  He says he is already losing weight due to his efforts. 

OBJECTIVE: 
Height  6 foot 2 inches.  Weight  204 pounds on 03/07/05.  Ideal body weight  190 pounds, plus or minus ten percent.  He is 107 percent standard of midpoint ideal body weight.  BMI  26.189.  A 48-year-old male.  Lab on 03/15/05  Cholesterol  251.  LDL  166.  VLDL  17.  HDL  68.  Triglycerides  87.  I explained to the patient the dietary guidelines to help improve his lipids.  I recommend a 26 to 51 to 77 fat grams per day for a 10 to 20 to 30 percent fat level of 2,300 calories since he is interested in losing weight.  I went over the printed information sheet on lowering your cholesterol and that was given to him along with a booklet on the same topic to read.  I encouraged him to continue as he is doing. 

ASSESSMENT: 
Basal energy expenditure 1960 x 1.44 activity factor is approximately 2,800 calories.  His 24-hour recall shows he is making many positive changes already to lower his fat and cholesterol intake.  He needs to continue as he is doing.  He verbalized understanding and seemed receptive. 

PLAN: 
The patient plans to recheck his lipids through Dr. XYZ  I gave him my phone number and he is to call me if he has any further questions regarding his diet.

Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 2. 

Description: 
Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary arteriographies, successful stenting of the left anterior descending diagonal. 

NAME OF PROCEDURE: 
Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary arteriographies, successful stenting of the left anterior descending diagonal. 

INDICATION: 
Recurrent angina.  History of coronary disease. 

TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: 
Standard Judkins, right groin. 

CATHETERS USED: 
6-French pigtail, 6-French JL4, 6-French JR4. 

ANTICOAGULATION: 
2000 of heparin, 300 of Plavix, was begun on Integrilin. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

STENT: 
For stenting we used a 6-French left Judkins guide.  Stent was a 275 x 13 Zeta. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives and risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of cardiac chamber, resection of an artery, arrhythmia requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, allergy, and need for vascular surgery.  All questions were answered and the patient decided to proceed. 

HEMODYNAMIC DATA: 
Aortic pressure was within physiologic range.  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve. 

ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA: 
1.  Ventriculogram  Left ventricle was of normal size and shape with normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.2.  Right coronary artery  Dominant.  There was a lesion in the proximal portion in the 60% range, insignificant disease distally.3.  Left coronary artery  The left main coronary artery showed insignificant disease.  The circumflex arose, showed about 30% proximally.  Left anterior descending arose and the previously placed stent was perfectly patent.  There was a large diagonal branch which showed 90% stenosis in its proximal portion.  There was a lesion in the 30% to 40% range even more proximal.I reviewed with the patient the options of medical therapy, intervention on the culprit versus bypass surgery.  He desired that we intervene.Successful stenting of the left anterior descending, diagonal.  The guide was placed in the left main.  We easily crossed the lesion in the diagonal branch of the left anterior descending.  We advanced, applied and post-dilated the 275 x 13 stent.  Final angiography showed 0% residual at the site of previous 90% stenosis.  The more proximal 30% to 40% lesion was unchanged. 

CONCLUSION: 
1.  Successful stenting of the left anterior descending/diagonal.  Initially there was 90% in the diagonal after stenting.  There was 0% residual.  There was a lesion a bit more proximal in the 40% range.2.  Left anterior descending stent remains patent.3.  30% in the circumflex.4.  60% in the right coronary.5.  Ejection fraction and wall motion are normal. 

PLAN: 
We have stented the culprit lesion.  The patient will receive a course of aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin, and statin therapy.  We used 6-French Angio-Seal in the groin.  All questions have been answered.  I have discussed the possibility of restenosis, need for further procedures.

Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Arthrodesis - 2. 

Description: 
Anterior cervical discectomy C4-C5 arthrodesis with 8 mm lordotic ACF spacer, corticocancellous, and stabilization with Synthes Vector plate and screws.  Cervical spondylosis and herniated nucleus pulposus of C4-C5. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Cervical spondylosis and herniated nucleus pulposus of C4-C5. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Cervical spondylosis and herniated nucleus pulposus of C4-C5. 

TITLE OF OPERATION: 
Anterior cervical discectomy C4-C5 arthrodesis with 8 mm lordotic ACF spacer, corticocancellous, and stabilization with Synthes Vector plate and screws. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Less than 100 mL. 

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
After identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.

ANESTHESIA: 
General endotracheal. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

PATIENT STATUS: 
Taken to recovery room in stable condition. 

INDICATIONS: 
The patient is a 36-year-old female who has had severe, recalcitrant right upper extremity pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, axial neck pain, and headaches for many months.  Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively. 

SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: 
Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.

EMG/Nerve Conduction Study - 3. 

Description: 
A right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident with no specific injury at that time. 

HISTORY: 
The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal. 

OBJECTIVE: 
Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle. 

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: 
Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex. 

NEEDLE EMG: 
Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles. 

IMPRESSION: 
This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.

On examination, the patient has bilateral bunions at the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  She states that they do not hurt.  No pain appears to be produced by active or passive range of motion or palpation and direct pressure of the first metatarsophalangeal joint bilaterally.  The patient has a bilateral pinch callus on the medial aspect of both great toes and there are calluses along the medial aspect of the right foot.  She has a small intractable plantar keratoma, plantar to her left second metatarsal head, which measures 0.5 cm in diameter.  This is a central plug.  She also has a very, very painful lesion plantar to her right fourth metatarsal head which measures 3.1 x 1.8 cm in diameter.  This is a hyperkeratotic lesion that extends deep into the tissue with interrupted skin lines.

1.  Bilateral bunions.       2.  Calluses.       3.  Heloma durum.       4.  Painful plantar lesions. 

P -: 
Aseptic technique was used.  The feet were scrubbed with Hibiclens.  Topical anesthetic was applied and the benign lesion on the plantar aspect of the left foot was excised.  Blood loss was minimal.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was dressed with Neosporin ointment and absorbent dressing.  The benign lesion on the plantar aspect of the right foot was excised as well.  Blood loss was minimal.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was dressed with Neosporin ointment and absorbent dressing.  The heloma durum was shaved bilaterally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was informed that she needs orthotics, but she says she cannot afford them.  I have recommended to the patient that she stop wearing the small old dress shoes that she is wearing today and obtain a good pair of support athletic-type shoes such as Reebok.  Followup is every three months or whenever needed.

Orchiectomy & Testis Fixation. 

Description: 
Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Nonpalpable right undescended testis. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis. 

PROCEDURES: 
Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. 

FLUID RECEIVED: 
250 mL of crystalloids. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Less than 5 mL. 

SPECIMEN: 
The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant. 

ABNORMAL FINDINGS: 
Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring.  Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring. 

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: 
The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis.  The plan is for evaluation and repair. 

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: 
The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  The patient was placed in supine position and examined.  The left testis well within scrotum.  The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.

HYPERFRACTIONATION: 
This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.

Lumbar Re-exploration. 

Description: 
Recurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 with L3 compression fracture adjacent to an instrumented fusion from T11 through L2 with hardware malfunction distal at the L2 end of the hardware fixation. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Recurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 with L3 compression fracture adjacent to an instrumented fusion from T11 through L2 with hardware malfunction distal at the L2 end of the hardware fixation. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Recurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 with L3 compression fracture adjacent to an instrumented fusion from T11 through L2 with hardware malfunction distal at the L2 end of the hardware fixation. 

PROCEDURE: 
Lumbar re-exploration for removal of fractured internal fixation plate from T11 through L2 followed by a repositioning of the L2 pedicle screws and evaluation of the fusion from T11 through L2 followed by a bilateral hemilaminectomy and diskectomy for decompression at L4-5 and L5-S1 with posterior lumbar interbody fusion using morselized autograft bone and the synthetic spacers from the Capstone system at L4-5 and L5-S1 followed by placement of the pedicle screw fixation devices at L3, L4, L5, and S1 and insertion of a 20 cm fixation plate that range from the T11 through S1 levels and then subsequent onlay fusion using morselized autograft bone and bone morphogenetic soaked sponge at L1-2 and then at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 bilaterally. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
This is a 68-year-old lady who presents with a history of osteomyelitis associated with the percutaneous vertebroplasty that was actually treated several months ago with removal of the infected vertebral augmentation and placement of a posterior pedicle screw plate fixation device from T11 through L2.  She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.

Following general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previously placed AlloDerm membrane was removed.  Mediastinal cultures were obtained, and the mediastinum was then profusely irrigated and suctioned.  Both cavities were also irrigated and suctioned.  The drains were flushed and repositioned.  Approximately 30 cubic centimeters of blood were drawn slowly from the right atrial line.  The sternum was then smeared with a vancomycin paste.  The proximal aspect of the 5 mm RV-PA conduit was marked with a small titanium clip at its inferior most aspect and with an additional one on its rightward inferior side.  The sternum was then closed with stainless steel wires followed by closure of subcutaneous tissues with interrupted monofilament stitches.  The skin was closed with interrupted nylon sutures and a sterile dressing was placed.  The peritoneal dialysis catheter, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were removed.  The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive unit shortly thereafter in very stable condition.I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

Dorsal Ramus & Branch Block. 

Description: 
Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block for sacroiliac joint pain.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. 

PROCEDURE: 
Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block. 

INDICATION: 
Sacroiliac joint pain. 

INFORMED CONSENT: 
The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. 

PROCEDURE: 
Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. 

ADDITIONAL DETAILS: 
This was then repeated on the left side. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

DISCUSSION: 
Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.

Sample Name: 
Upper Endoscopy. 

Description: 
Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. 

PROCEDURE: 
Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5. 

OPERATIVE NOTE: 
Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted. 

IMPRESSION: 
Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.

Consult - History and Phy. 

Sample Name: 
Consult - Palpitations & Presyncope. 

Description: 
The patient admitted with palpitations and presyncope. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a charming and delightful 46-year-old woman admitted with palpitations and presyncope.The patient is active and a previously healthy young woman, who has had nine years of occasional palpitations.  Symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  She has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  Symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  The last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  On neither occasion did she lose consciousness.Yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  While working on a computer, she had a spell.  Palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital's admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  She was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since.No history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  She does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is a mother of two.  There is no family history of congenital heart disease.  She has had no history of thoracic trauma.  No symptoms to suggest thyroid disease.No known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  Family history is negative for ischemic heart disease.Remote history is significant for an ACL repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast.No regular medications prior to admission.The only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
Vital signs as charted.  Pupils are reactive.  Sclerae nonicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck veins not distended.  No bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  Extremities well perfused.  No edema.  Strong and symmetrical distal pulses.A 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  No evidence of preexcitation. 

LABORATORY STUDIES: 
Unremarkable.  No evidence of myocardial injury.  Thyroid function is pending.Two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease. 

IMPRESSION/PLAN: 
Episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  Outpatient workup would be appropriate.  Event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  Suppressive medication (beta-blocker or Cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  The patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible.Thank you for this consultation.  We will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  Caffeine avoidance was discussed as well. 

ADDENDUM: 
During her initial evaluation, a D-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  In addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.

Description: 
Dilation and curettage (D&C), laparoscopy, right salpingectomy, lysis of adhesions, and evacuation of hemoperitoneum.  Pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and hemoperitoneum. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Pelvic pain.2.  Ectopic pregnancy. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Pelvic pain.2.  Ectopic pregnancy.3.  Hemoperitoneum. 

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:

ANESTHESIA: 
General endotracheal. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Scant from the operation, however, there was approximately 2 liters of clotted and old blood in the abdomen. 

SPECIMENS: 
Endometrial curettings and right fallopian tube. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

FINDINGS: 
On bimanual exam, the patient has a small anteverted uterus, it is freely mobile.  No adnexal masses, however, were appreciated on the bimanual exam.  Laparoscopically, the patient had numerous omental adhesions to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus.  There were also adhesions to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube.  There was a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liters of clotted and unclotted blood.  There was some questionable gestational tissue ________ on the left sacrospinous ligament.  There was an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube. 

PROCEDURE: 
After an informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the vagina.  The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank and then a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue was then sent to pathology.  At this point, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was then turned to the abdomen.  The surgeons all are removed the dirty gloves in the previous portion of the case.  Next, a 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Next, a syringe was used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle.  The normal saline was seen to drop freely, so a Veress needle was connected to the CO2 gas which was started at its lowest setting.  The gas was seen to flow freely with normal resistance, so the CO2 gas was advanced to a higher setting.  The abdomen was insufflated to an adequate distension.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  The introducer was removed and the trocar was connected to the CO2 gas and a camera was inserted.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadths below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera.  A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #5 trocar was inserted under direct visualization.  Next a size #5 port was placed approximately five fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion.  A size #12 port was placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization.  The laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the suprapubic port and this was used to dissect the omental adhesions bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes.  Next, the Dorsey suction irrigator was used to copiously irrigate the abdomen.  Approximate total of 3 liters of irrigation was used and the majority of all blood clots and free blood was removed from the abdomen.Once the majority of blood was cleaned from the abdomen, the ectopic pregnancy was easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube was grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device was then inserted through the right upper quadrant with # 12 port.  Three bites with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy.  An EndoCatch bag was then placed to the size #12 port and this was used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy.  This was then sent to the pathology.  Next, the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic.  The abdomen was further irrigated.  The liver was examined and appeared to be within normal limits.  At this point, the two size #5 ports and a size #12 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was then removed.  The CO2 gas was disconnected and the abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced in a size #11 port and the whole port and introducer was removed as a single unit.  All laparoscopic incisions were closed with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  They were then steri-stripped and bandaged appropriately.  At the end of the procedure, the uterine manipulator was removed from the cervix and the patient was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She was discharged home with a postoperative hemoglobin of 8.9.  She was given iron 325 mg to be taken twice a day for five months and Darvocet-N 100 mg to be taken every four to six hours for pain.  She will follow up within a week in the OB resident clinic.

Fetal Anatomical Survey. 

Description: 
The patient is a 39-year-old gravida 3, para 2, who is now at 20 weeks and 2 days gestation.  This pregnancy is a twin gestation.  The patient presents for her fetal anatomical survey. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
The patient denies any significant past medical history.

SOCIAL HISTORY: 
She denies use of cigarettes, alcohol or drugs. 

FAMILY HISTORY: 
No family history of birth defects, mental retardation or any psychiatric history. 

DETAILS: 
I performed a transabdominal ultrasound today using a 4 MHz transducer.  There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you.Total visit time 40 minutes.

INDICATIONS: 
This is a 36-year-old African-American female gravida 4, para-2-0-1-2, who presents for elective repeat cesarean section.  The patient has previous cesarean section x2 and refuses trial of labor.  The patient also requests a tubal ligation for permanent sterilization and family planning. 

FINDINGS: 
A female infant in cephalic presentation in a ROP position.  Apgars of 9 and 9 at one and five minutes respectively.  Weight is 6 lb 2 oz and loose nuchal cord x1.  Normal uterus, tubes, and ovaries. 

PROCEDURE: 
After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room, where spinal anesthetic was found to be adequate.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient's previous Pfannenstiel scar incision was removed and the incision was carried through the underlying layer of fascia using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline and the fascial incision was extended laterally using the second knife.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostats, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was then inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, grasped with an Allis clamp and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted and a small transverse incision was made along the lower uterine segment.  This incision was extended laterally manually.  The amniotic fluid was ruptured at this point with clear fluid obtained.  The infant's head was delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were both suctioned on delivery.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  Cord gases and cord bloods were obtained and sent.  The placenta was then removed manually and the uterus exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was reapproximated with #0 chromic in a running lock fashion.  A second layer of the same suture was used with excellent hemostasis.  Attention was now turned to the right fallopian tube, which was grasped with the Babcock and avascular space below the tube was entered using a hemostat.  The tube was doubly clamped using hemostat and the portion between the clamps was removed using Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends of the tube were cauterized using the Bovie and they were then tied off with #2-0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the left fallopian tube, which was grasped with the Babcock and avascular space beneath the tube was entered using a hemostat.  The tube was then doubly clamped with hemostat and the portion of tube between them was removed using the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends of the tubes were cauterized and the tube was suture-ligated with #2-0 Vicryl.  There were some adhesions of the omentum to the bilateral adnexa.  These were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors with excellent hemostasis noted.  The uterus was then returned to the abdomen and the bladder was cleared of all clots.  The uterine incision was reexamined and found to be hemostatic.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Several interrupted sutures of #3-0 chromic were placed in the subcutaneous tissue.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital.

Meatoplasty Template. 

Description: 
An example/template for meatoplasty. 

OPERATIVE NOTE: 
The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.  At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis.  There was good hemostasis and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.

Sample Name: 
Mammoplasty - 2. 

Description: 
Bilateral augmentation mammoplasty, breast implant, TCA peel to lesions, vein stripping. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Breast hypoplasia, melasma to the face, and varicose veins to the posterior aspect of the right distal thigh/popliteal fossa area. 

PROCEDURES: 
1.  Bilateral augmentation mammoplasty, subglandular with a mammary gel silicone breast implant, 435 cc each.2.  TCA peel to two lesions of the face and vein stripping to the right posterior thigh and popliteal fossa area. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General endotracheal. 

EBL: 
100 cc. 

IV FLUIDS: 
2L. 

URINE OUTPUT: 
Per Anesthesia. 

INDICATION FOR SURGERY: 
The patient is a 48-year-old female who was seen in clinic by Dr. W and where she was evaluated for her small breasts as well as dark areas on her face and varicose veins to the back and posterior aspect of her right lower extremity.  She requested that surgical procedures to be performed for correction of these abnormalities.  As such, complications were explained to the patient including infection, bleeding, poor wound healing, and need for additional surgery.  The patient subsequently signed the consent and requested that Dr. W and associates to perform the procedure. 

TECHNIQUE: 
The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position.  General anesthesia was induced and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The posterior thigh of the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  First, multiple serial small incisions less than 1 cm in length were made to the posterior aspect of the right thigh and sequential stripping of the varicose veins was performed.  Once these varicose veins had been completely stripped and avulsed, then next the wounds were then irrigated and were cleaned with wet and dry, and all the incisions were closed with the use of 5-0 Monocryl buried interrupted sutures.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, ABDs and a TED hose.  Next, the patient was then flipped back over onto the stretcher and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  The anterior chest was then prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Next, a 10 blade was placed through previous circumareolar incisions from a previous augmentation mammoplasty.  Dissection was carried out with a 10 blade and Bovie cautery until the pectoralis fascia was identified to both breasts.  Once the pectoralis muscle and fascia were identified, then a surgical plane was created in a subglandular layer.  The hemostasis was obtained to both breast pockets with the Bovie cautery and suction and irrigation was performed to bilateral breast pockets as well.  A sizer was used to identify the appropriate size of the silicone implant to be used.  This was determined to be approximately 435 cc bilaterally.  As such, two mammary gel silicone breast implants were placed in a subglandular muscle.  Additional dissection of the breast pockets were performed bilaterally and the patient was sequentially placed in the upright sitting position for evaluation of appropriate placement of the mammary gel silicone implants.  Once it was determined that the implants were appropriately selected and placed with the 435 cc silicon gel implant, the circumareolar incisions were closed in approximately 4-layered fashion closing the fascia, subcutaneous tissue, deep dermis, and a running dermal subcuticular for final skin closure.  This was performed with 3-0 Monocryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for running subcuticular.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, and Xeroform and dressed with sample Kerlix.  Next, our attention was paid to the face where 25% TCA solution was applied to two locations; one on the left cheek and the other one on the right cheek, where a hyperpigmentation/melasma.  Several applications of the TCA peel was performed, and at the end of this, the frosting was noted to both spots.  At the end of the case, needle and instrument counts were correct.  Dr. W was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken to the PACU in stable condition.

DRAINS: 
None. 

SPECIMENS: 
Right breast skin and lesions x2. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

INDICATIONS: 
This patient is a 54-year-old white female who presents for a revision of her previous bilateral breast reconstruction.  The patient had asymmetry as well as right breast hypertrophy, and therefore, the procedures named above were indicated.  The patient was informed about the possible risks and complications of the above procedures and gave an informed consent. 

PROCEDURE: 
The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operative table.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was established and IV prophylactic antibiotics were given, the chest and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.Attention was first turned to the left breast where liposuction was performed laterally to allow for better contour and minimize the outer quadrant.  The incision was made for this and was then closed with 5-0 Prolene interrupted suture.Attention was then turned to the right breast where liposuction was also performed to reduce the medial superior and lateral quadrants.  Once this was performed, the vertical reduction mammoplasty was outlined.  Prior to that, the nipple reconstruction was performed with a keyhole pattern flap.  The flap was elevated with 15-blade and hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie.  The flap was then sutured onto itself and secured with 5-0 Prolene interrupted sutures.  Then the lateral and medial limbs were undermined to close the defect and this was performed with 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures.  Subsequently, the reduction mastectomy skin was then excised sharply and passed up the table marked and sent to Pathology. Hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie and then undermining was performed in the medial, superior, and lateral skin to allow for closure of the reduction incisions.  Once this was performed, a 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures were used to close the inferior limb.  Subsequently 2-0 PDS continuous suture was then placed in the periareolar area to close the defect, with a diameter that equaled the new nipple areolar complex.  Once this was performed, the remaining incision was then closed with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Subsequently, the 2 lesions were excised, the larger one which was medial and the lateral one that was smaller that were excised sharply, passed up the table and sent to Pathology.  They were closed in 2 layers using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.Attention was then turned to the abdominal scars where liposuction and tumescent solution of diluted epinephrine were used to minimize the amount of excision that was required.  Subsequently the extra skin was excised sharply in an elliptical fashion on the right side measuring approximately 10 x 3 cm, this was the superior and inferior skin, was when undermined and closure was performed after hemostasis was obtained with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.Attention was then turned to the contralateral left side where there was a larger defect.  There was a larger excision required measuring approximately 15 x 3 cm.  The superior and inferior edges of skin were undermined and closed primarily using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips were placed on all incisions followed by surgical bra.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without complications and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  All instruments, needle counts, and sponges were correct at the end of the case.

Sample Name: 
ORIF - Left Tibia. 

Description: 
Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Comminuted left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with intraarticular extension. 

PROCEDURE: 
Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General.  The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic. 

TOURNIQUET TIME: 
80 minutes. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
Minimal. 

DRAINS: 
One JP drain was placed. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
No intraoperative complications or specimens.  Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers. 

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: 
The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan. 

PROCEDURE: 
The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition. 

POSTOP PLAN: 
The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.  The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case.

Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 
Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. 

PROCEDURES: 
C5-C6 and C6-C7 anterior cervical discectomy (two levels) C5-C6 and C6-C7 allograft fusions.  A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used. 

ANESTHESIA: 
General endotracheal. 

COMPLICATIONS: 
None. 

INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: 
This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.
